# 100-Days-of-Data-and-Python
 Transformation / Modification of the 100 Days of Code

 ### The initial idea 23.02.2023

Back in december I started with the 100 Days o Code Challenge but I failed. Because of beeing sick, beeing pressured to apply to find a job, coping with the circumstances around me and several other reasons.
Failing harddisc followed by data-loss and the new harddisc also failing after a few days. It sucks. 

I am still in the same spot but I have to go on with learning and all that stuff. So I have to find a work-around to get things working out. Especially finally getting into Python. And also getting stuff out for the portfolio-page.
And getting on with the language learning. Ahhh!

A lot to do, to organize. Several construction sites.

But I will make it.

So. Where do we go from here?
I decided to modify the 100 Days of Code into something else.
Namely: 

100 Days of Data and Python

It will include the work on Data and Python but will also go further and cover the language learning, writing and other stuff. In my opinion, all these things are linked together and it's also a process.

Also, with three kids around and something big (really big!) coming up in the next weeks, I don't know if progress is possible every day. So I pull the plug on this daily regime. But still working as much as possible - hopefully every day. We will see how things play out.

Even with little steps day in day out it's progress.

Like Elwood said back in the day: 

## "It's 106 miles to Chicago, we got a full tank of gas, half a pack of cigarettes, it's dark... and we're wearing sunglasses." Jake: "Hit it."
