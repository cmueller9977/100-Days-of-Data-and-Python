# 100 Days of Data and Python - Personal Log

### Day 4 - 26.02.2023




### Day 3 - 25.02.2023

Starting with a Dutch podcast and it's transcript. Also vocabulary. 

Working on the MOM Infographic / Dashboard. 
Checked for best resolutions for Dashboards. Found an idea for data modelling for the capital bikeshare project (with the geo data).

Inner French Podcast about AI. First thought: it's too slow for me. Maybe an indicator that I've made progress? Who knows.

Reading articles about Docker. Something that interests me since a while. How could it be possible used in data analytics. Mostly it seems it's used in data science. But how to make use of it in analytics?



### Day 2 - 24.02.2023

Again started with a short podcast and the transcript in Dutch. 

Going over excercises in Python but something seems wrong with my python installation or my vscode. Have to figure it out first.

Always reading different stuff on Medium or all over the internet. A daily habbit. The question is, if I should share the (imho) best articles / sources?
If somebody reads this: let me know what to do. 



### Day 1 - 23.02.2023

Dutch: Podcast and transcript. Dutch online acamday has a few good ones seperated by level.

Managed to get a Power BI free license. Now I have a workspace and can publish dashboards. Yay!

Also hunting for makeover monday for a solution to embed video into a dashboard. Found a solution but have to look how it works. Also only possible because of the free license. Now I have access to the Power BI marketplace.
Video isn't working. But webpages is a thing. So a bit different. Coming back later to embed videos.

Participated in an info-session of BeCode for a Data / AI bootcamp. Maybe that's something to go for. Have to make assessment in Python for that. So let's go on with Python.

In the background I am working on the first step of the capital bikeshare project. 

Also found a nice plug-in for pivoter.be to display tables on a page - for showing examples of data-sources.
A plug-in to display code is somthing i still have to look for.
