# 100 Days of Data and Python - Personal Log

### Day 11 - 06.03.2023

Did a bit yesterday for french too but not that much. So, here we have another monday and we start over.

Checked the mom for this week. Don't know. It's a really basic dataset and lacks so much info. Thinking about to add other sources that could be important to understand the development at least a bit better.

Dutch-Podcast: Level A2 - B1. Works fine. 
Since a few days using the practice function at datacamp for python. Nice feature.


### Day 10 - 04.03.2023

French: creating excel-files for vocabs. Also grammar passé composé.
Not much more because our visitors.


### Day 9 - 03.03.2023

Had an interview. Will see what comes around.

Bug-hunting for publihing reports. Now it's working. Seems I posted the wrong link but I don't know for sure.

Heading for week 9 of wow2023.

Found a template for an interactive CV for Power BI. Very nice. It's over at wow2023.

### Day 8 - 02.03.2023

Data modeling for makeover monday - caffeine content
Also discoverd the Workout Wednesday - Just checking.
Interesting articel about Geodata and analysis (Softqware) could be useful for Bikeshare?

For MOM data modeling. calculated column - ratio in mg / ml. now how do i put that in a viz?
Almost done the thing. Also a bit of Python. Ah its already done. 

Wireframes! Check it out!



### Day 7 - 01.03.2023

Difficult today. Visitors are coming for a few days. So we have to clean things a bit up. And it's the short school day. So kids are back home early.

Plan is later that day going again after Datacamp and the Python Track. Need that for the BeCode test. Repeating the Chapters.
Also Dutch: Yesterday I had class and it's always a ton to do afterwards. Topic: Perfectum.



### Day 6 - 28.02.2023

Better today. Almost enough sleep.

Ended 30 days of continuous posting things on linkedin. Now adjust it to 3 times a week.

Found this: https://superset.apache.org/ 
Seems I should try it out. ^^

French: passsé composé 

Thinking about what is possible with the IFrames in Power BI

Also making a Data Viz Tool usable for language learning. How about that:
For French:
The Modi (4) -> Drill in: Next Level are the temps included in that Mode.
Next level down: you get the verbs with the endings (the konjugated verbs).
Qustion for that level is if you get right now to the verbs and the declinations all together for one verb or one by one.

By getting to fill my gaps I am trying to develop a path - a step by step guide. First approach is coming from "two sides" from the level of the modi downward but at the same time starting from the "lowest level" the endings of the verbs. A Dashboard described above could imho offer an overview with the possibility to go into the details by the drill-down.
How do I organize the data? Maybe starting with an Excel-Sheet. The question is how to organizie it. Thinking about it.
Identifying the most (let's say) 100 verbs as a basis.

### Day 5 - 27.02.2023

Very tired today. Will be a difficult thing today. 

Started with a dutch podcast and the transcript. 

Posted the makeover monday week 8 report. Have to write a more detailed version on pivoter.be.

Also: the big big thing is getting closer and docs and stuff needs to be done. 
And: I need a plan!

French: I finally have to start to fill my gaps / repeat all the stuff. That includes the temps. First stop: passé composé. Also I should creat summaries of the different topics. For me, for others. Same for Dutch. 
I think my focus was more on dutch and i missed a bit in french. Have to get into a balance.

I am really tired today and it's hard to keep focus.




### Day 4 - 26.02.2023

Capital Bikeshare project: Having a second file with the locations I need to build a different data model with the rides as fact table and the locations (and the geo data) as a dimension

Wordpress: GitHub embed for repos. Now I need another one to embed code in the right way. Have to try out different add-ons.

Finished the protein report for Makeover Monday Week 8. To publish it it needs to be admin. So figuring this out is next.
Finally worked and the report is published. Cool. :)

If you use something like Maven to publish a portfolio all these things behind the scenes are missed. All these things with the licenses, administration and so on. I really like to do things with my wordpress-page. You learn so much more instead of using a predifend service. So cool!


### Day 3 - 25.02.2023

Starting with a Dutch podcast and it's transcript. Also vocabulary. 

Working on the MOM Infographic / Dashboard. 
Checked for best resolutions for Dashboards. Found an idea for data modelling for the capital bikeshare project (with the geo data).

Inner French Podcast about AI. First thought: it's too slow for me. Maybe an indicator that I've made progress? Who knows.

Reading articles about Docker. Something that interests me since a while. How could it be possible used in data analytics. Mostly it seems it's used in data science. But how to make use of it in analytics?



### Day 2 - 24.02.2023

Again started with a short podcast and the transcript in Dutch. 

Going over excercises in Python but something seems wrong with my python installation or my vscode. Have to figure it out first.

Always reading different stuff on Medium or all over the internet. A daily habbit. The question is, if I should share the (imho) best articles / sources?
If somebody reads this: let me know what to do. 



### Day 1 - 23.02.2023

Dutch: Podcast and transcript. Dutch online acamday has a few good ones seperated by level.

Managed to get a Power BI free license. Now I have a workspace and can publish dashboards. Yay!

Also hunting for makeover monday for a solution to embed video into a dashboard. Found a solution but have to look how it works. Also only possible because of the free license. Now I have access to the Power BI marketplace.
Video isn't working. But webpages is a thing. So a bit different. Coming back later to embed videos.

Participated in an info-session of BeCode for a Data / AI bootcamp. Maybe that's something to go for. Have to make assessment in Python for that. So let's go on with Python.

In the background I am working on the first step of the capital bikeshare project. 

Also found a nice plug-in for pivoter.be to display tables on a page - for showing examples of data-sources.
A plug-in to display code is somthing i still have to look for.
