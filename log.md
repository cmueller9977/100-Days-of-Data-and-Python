# 100 Days of Data and Python - Personal Log

### Day 1 

Dutch: Podcast and transcript. Dutch online acamday has a few good ones seperated by level.

Managed to get a Power BI free license. Now I have a workspace and can publish dashboards. Yay!

Also hunting for makeover monday for a solution to embed video into a dashboard. Found a solution but have to look how it works. Also only possible because of the free license. Now I have access to the Power BI marketplace.
Video isn't working. But webpages is a thing. So a bit different. Coming back later to embed videos.

Participated in an info-session of BeCode for a Data / AI bootcamp. Maybe that's something to go for. Have to make assessment in Python for that. So let's go on with Python.

In the background I am working on the first step of the capital bikeshare project. 

Also found a nice plug-in for pivoter.be to display tables on a page - for showing examples of data-sources.
A plug-in to display code is somthing i still have to look for.
